# UEFReader
 Reads UEF files, which are used by various BBC Micro, Acorn Electron and Acorn Atom emulators, to store mainly tape files. UEF is 'Unified Emulator Format', and the full specification for this can be found at http://electrem.emuunlim.com/UEFSpecs.htm.<br>

This has been primarily written to get the code working before I incorporate it into Disc Image Manager. However, I am making the source code available for all (as it will be available once in Disc Image Manager anyway). So, this should be considered a test tool rather than a full utility, even though it can be used to extract files from UEF files.<br>
